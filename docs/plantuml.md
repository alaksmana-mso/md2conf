# PlantUML

Although PlantUML diagram is not natively supported by GitHub, it is also not supported by `mark`. None of these gonna render in Confluence. For VS Code, I recommend [Markdown Preview Enhanced by Yiyi Wang](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced). You would also need to supply the jar/server.

## Inline

```plantuml
@startuml
Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response

Alice -> Bob: Another authentication Request
Alice <-- Bob: Another authentication Response
@enduml
```

## Image link

While this renders in editor (with extension), it does not supported by GitHub nor `mark`.

## Color

Can also do fancy features like changing colours.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Bob #red
' The only difference between actor
'and participant is the drawing
participant Alice
participant "I have a really\nlong name" as L #99FF99
/' You can also declare:
   participant L as "I have a really\nlong name"  #99FF99
  '/

Alice->Bob: Authentication Request
Bob->Alice: Authentication Response
Bob->L: Log transaction
@enduml
```

Changing colours.

```plantuml
@startuml
Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
alt#Gold #LightBlue Successful case
    Bob -> Alice: Authentication Accepted
else #Pink Failure
    Bob -> Alice: Authentication Rejected
end
@enduml
```

And changing colours.

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam backgroundColor #EEEBDC
skinparam handwritten true

skinparam sequence {
ArrowColor DeepSkyBlue
ActorBorderColor DeepSkyBlue
LifeLineBorderColor blue
LifeLineBackgroundColor #A9DCDF

ParticipantBorderColor DeepSkyBlue
ParticipantBackgroundColor DodgerBlue
ParticipantFontName Impact
ParticipantFontSize 17
ParticipantFontColor #A9DCDF

ActorBackgroundColor aqua
ActorFontColor DeepSkyBlue
ActorFontSize 17
ActorFontName Aapex
}

actor User
participant "First Class" as A
participant "Second Class" as B
participant "Last Class" as C

User -> A: DoWork
activate A

A -> B: Create Request
activate B

B -> C: DoWork
activate C
C --> B: WorkDone
destroy C

B --> A: Request Created
deactivate B

A --> User: Done
deactivate A

@enduml
```

_Yeah, that's it. What more feature do you need for your diagram?_
